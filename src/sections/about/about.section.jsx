			IGNITING LEADERS, ILLUMINATING COMMUNITIES, AND INSPIRING LEGACIES.
		</h3>
		<p>
			We are a co-ed business leadership fraternity committed to inspire
			the best in everyone. We aspire to become visionaries, influencers,
			and mobilizers. This means we dream big, rally support, and get it
			done. Our mission is clear – to inspire leaders. As a Partnership,
			our members are each co-owners of this mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are differentiated in that our Partners don’t just want to land a
			career, we each want to fulfill a calling. We are proud of our
			history of campus community leaders and founders. During their short
			time on campus, they each left a legacy because they saw a need to
			fill, a problem to solve, or someone to care about. We are inspired
			to carry on the torch with the aim to leave our world better than we
			found it.
