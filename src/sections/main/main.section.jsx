				<h3>OUR CORE VALUES</h3>
				<p>
					Our motto is “Grow Forward, Give Back”, and it resonates
					with every action our Partners set forth to do. The motto
					stems from our Founding Fathers’ history of personal and
					professional development and their usage of such experiences
					to create and foster an environment to benefit future
					business students. They chose to leave this legacy behind
					and now we dedicate ourselves to execute their vision.
					Lambda Phi Nu has since diversified our brotherhood, and we
					strive to cultivate future leaders in a wide variety of
					fields. Each member brings their unique talents and
					accomplishments to Lambda Phi Nu, but we truly impact the
					community on a grand scale when we unite as a brotherhood.
					We strive to make history. One goal, one step, one idea, at
					a time. At Lambda Phi Nu, we believe that through individual
					growth, one is able to give back and help the business
					community and society at large. Through our Leadership
					Accelerator Program and passion-filled environment, we aim
					to provide a transformative experience for students seeking
					mentorship and professional opportunities.
